      <h3>Elia Tyson</h3>
      <p>Founder / Author / Website Creator</p>
      <p class="biotext"><img src="./Profile Pictures/Elia Profile Pic.jpg" class="biopic" />Elia Tyson is 16 years old, and has many interests and passions, of which the most important is glorifying God. After that comes writing, reading, translating, music, animation, programming, and many other things. His current projects include a (currently top secret) series of short stories for the Flabbit Blog, a full length novel called The Velaxiarra Saga, Part 1 (working title), and a music album called Walk With Me (created with Cora Armani, the other member of their band Rysen). He has five siblings (aged 12 to under a year) and two wonderful parents. He lives in Isaan, Thailand, but is currently visiting America.

      <h3>The White Knight</h3>
      <p>Head Historian / Author / Uncle</p>
      <p class="biotext"><img src="./Profile Pictures/White Knight Profile Pic.jpg" class="biopic" />The White Knight is the eldest of the Flabbits, who enjoys reading, writing, analyzing films both good and bad, and loving the Lord his God with all his heart, soul, mind and strength. He is a homeschooler and a founding member of The Flabbit Room alongside his friend Elia Tyson. He is the author of the short story Winternacht, several unfinished novels, a teller of tales, a spinner of yarns, and a bit of a sage old uncle figure. The armor in his profile picture is not for sale. He has wonderful parents, a beautiful little sister, and a loving and gracious dog who is now accepting applications to help her take over the world. He lives contentedly in East Tennessee.</p>

      <h3>Buddy J.</h3>
      <p>Former Head Coordinator / Author / Website Editor</p>
      <p class="biotext"><img src="./Profile Pictures/Buddy Profile Pic.jpg" class="biopic" />Buddy J. (aka Big Brother Flabbit) is the author of his own blog while doubling as the Head Coordinator of the Flabbit Room's very own Ildathore. He loves writing about light and truth, playing his Mountain Ocarina to the wind, and even sketching little drawings here and there. Although the word "Bio" does not stand for biology, rest assured he is biological and not just a computer (most of the time). His birthplace is the Anza Valley in Southern CA, though the forests of East Texas are what he calls home, and if you listen closely the word "yall" will pop up here and there (though without a heavy accent). If you want to read more of his stories go to <a href="http://thebookshelfstaircase.wordpress.com" target="_blank">thebookshelfstaircase.wordpress.com</a>.</p>

      <h3>Evelyn Kelly</h3>
      <p>Head Coordinator / Website Writer / Author / Waspsbane</p>
      <p class="biotext"><img src="./Profile Pictures/Evelyn Profile Pic.jpg" class="biopic" />Evelyn Kelly is a Christian, a bookworm, a homeschooled high schooler, and a lover of rain and driving with the windows down. She enjoys to write and you can read some of her musings and poems here at her blog: <a href="http://evelynsbooknook.blogspot.com" target="_blank">evelynsbooknook.blogspot.com</a>. She is also a member of The Flabbit Room but finds it hard to write a bio about herself because you cannot really describe yourself in only a couple sentences. So if you actually care to know about her, perhaps go meet her or something else, but don't rely on only a couple sentences, even if she wrote them herself.</p>

      <h3>Sabina B.</h3>
      <p>Artist / Author / Cartographer</p>
      <p class="biotext"><img src="./Profile Pictures/Sabina Profile Pic.jpg" class="biopic" />Sabina B. is a thirteen-year-old Christian MK (missionary kid) and author living in Macedonia. She has written two books, has had some writing published on Clay Magazine, and enjoys sketching just about anything in her free time. She hopes to be a professional author and illustrator one day. If you meet her and insult either J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Andrew Peterson, Paul McCusker, or stuffed animals, she will most likely bonk you on the nose.</p>

      <h3>Bethel</h3>
      <p>Author / Cartographer</p>
      <p class="biotext"><img src="./Profile Pictures/Bethel Profile Pic.JPG" class="biopic" />Bethel is, among other things, a reader of books and writer of stories, who writes to glorify the King of the world. She likes horses, so it's a rare thing if her stories don't have horses in them. She won't tell you where she lives because her dad is in the military, and the place she lives now might not necessarily be the place she will be in a year. When she's not writing or reading, she might be programming, sleeping, or playing the piano. Now that you've read this, you can go do something else and maybe read something more worthwhile, like The Lord of the Rings, or The Wingfeather Saga, both of which which she heartily recommends.</p>

      <h3>Noah Aikens</h3>
      <p>Songwriter / Musician</p>
      <p class="biotext"><img src="./Profile Pictures/Noah Profile Pic.jpg" class="biopic" />Noah is 16 years old. Despite going by his first name, he prefers his middle name &mdash; Calvin &mdash; mainly because two famous theologians were named after him. He spends his time playing and writing music, enjoying the great outdoors, and procrastinating on the not so great internet. Even though he lives in the landlocked state of Tennessee, Noah constantly wonders how long he can tread water.</p>

      <h3>Jeremiah K.</h3>
      <p>Illustrator</p>
      <p class="biotext"><img src="./Profile Pictures/Jeremiah Profile Pic.jpg" class="biopic2" />Jeremiah K. Is a 13 year old PK (Pastor's Kid) who enjoys writing, acting, drawing, singing and many other things. He loves to draw, especially fantasy. Now that you have read this you can do whatever you like to do, and do it all for the glory of God. Oh, and he also enjoys being a Flabbit!</p>
