      <h1>Blog</h1>
      <p>of Flabbits, the Flabbit Blog, The (Occasionally Interrupted) <a href="./ildathore.html">Ildathore</a> Chronicles; it has many names, but there is only one blog on the internet written, edited, and uploaded entirely by the Flabbits, and it is on this page. We hope you enjoy it. (Note: we thought about putting one of those handy category and date widgets on the side to help you find older posts, but decided it would be more fun to tell you to "just keep scrolling.")</p>
