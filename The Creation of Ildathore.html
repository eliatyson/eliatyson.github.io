    <h2>The Creation of Ildathore</h2>
    <div class="storytext">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">Before the beginning there was not nothing. The Indescribable was there, Whose vast pleasure it was to create time and space. These He created as a labyrinth of light, complex in beauty, full and blinding. But not only such things did He create, but also someone to explore them: the man.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Being woven from strands of silver and gold, his heart beating and eyes seeing. Life flowed through him in majestic grace.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">But the light surrounding was too great for him to comprehend. Turning in every direction, he saw no place to begin. So The Indescribable pulled a strand from the labyrinth and formed a path; an endless path for the man to follow, so he could explore the glory forever.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The start of the path was a great globe, holding light in such a way as is understandable by the man.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">And the Creator spoke to the man: "It is called Ildathore; it is Our Meaning. I give you reign to explore it, tame it, and weave the light."</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Looking down at the pulsing light beneath his feet, the man wondered at the beauty around him, searching again for a place to start. </p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">"Look."</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Turning, the man saw the light being woven, it's strands intertwining, forming something. At the very center, a sapphire orb jumped to and fro. Around the sapphire was created a wall of armor scales, shining with emerald light. Legs and forelegs extended, and the creature stood, showing its strength. Opening a great mouth, the beast roared, and wings spread from its back.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The beast knelt before man, and the Creator said, "This is where you may start. Go forth and weave."</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Man closed his eyes and nodded, then opened them. Speaking to the beast, he said, "Bethoch you shall be called, and first of all, I shall give you a place to rest." So he went to his knees on the sphere of light and beauty, and set his hands down. The light began separating, becoming thousands of strands to be woven by the man. He took a single thread, and formed it into a plant.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Then, kneeling down, he whispered to it and, as the power of the creation flowed through his words, it grew, covering the orb in many different shapes and colors. Still on his knees, he pulled up a small patch of green blades, and called grass. Reaching forth again the man touched a different thread and turned it to hard rock; silent, yet hard and firm. And between the rock and the grass, he wove a layer of dirt.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Turning back to Bethoch, he said, "I give you this place to be your bed. Now go, stretch your wings."</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Bowing, the beast turned and leaped into the air, letting his strong wings carry him as the man wove a gust of wind. As he watched the beast go, man saw the sky darken, but not before thousands of small lights were placed in the sky. A light breeze blew, and he realized he was watching the Creator at work again, forming the universe beyond his reach.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">A flame joy lit in him, and in the beauty of night, man grasped more light and began weaving it. He turned about, finding delight in weaving beasts of all kind, naming them, and setting them loose, as the rocks grew together, setting forth land, and the dirt created beds covered in springy grass.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The man then turned about, looking for someone to tell of his joy, but the beasts were not like him. None could man create to be as he. So turning back to the Creator, man called out, asking for another creature to be with him, one to feel as he did, one to live in accordance with. Then from behind came a voice...</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">"Delightfull... all of it is."</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">And upon turning about, man was speechless. His request was answered, but in a way he never imagined. Everything her gaze fell on was covered in a grace and loveliness. Creatures softened, love for their weaver and his mate filling them, and a graceful substance called water filled parts of Ildathore.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Locking eyes with the man, she spoke again. "Here I am to share in the beauty, weaving alongside you. Forever we shall be in unison; one heart and one will."</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">And thus was the creation of Ildathore.<br>&nbsp</p>
