    <h2>The Creation of Ildathore</h2>
    <p>Before the beginning there was not nothing. The Indescribable was there, Whose vast pleasure it was to create time and space. These He created as a labyrinth of light, complex in beauty, full and blinding. But not only such things did He create, but someone to explore them.</p>
    <p>The man. Being woven from strands of silver and gold, his hair was alight and eyes seeing. Life flowed through him in majestic grace.</p>
    <p>But the light surrounding was too great for him to comprehend. And turning in every direction he saw only labyrinth. So The Indescribable pulled a strand from every weave and formed a path; An endless path for the man to follow, endless so he could explore the glory forever.</p>
    <p>The start of the path was a great globe, holding light in such a way as is understandable by the man.</p>
    <p>And spoken to the man was this, "It is called Ildathore, It is Our Meaning. I give you reign to tame it, explore it, and find whatever you may find. Study the weaving of light."</p>
    <p>Looking down at the pulsing light beneath his feet, the man said, "But where do I start?" He wondered at the beauty around him, searching for a place to begin. </p>
    <p>"Look."</p>
    <p>Turning, the man saw the light being woven, it's strands intertwining, forming something. At the very center, a sapphire orb jumped to and fro. Around the sapphire was created a wall of armor scales, boasting emerald light. Legs and forelegs extended, and the creature stood up showing its strength. Opening a great mouth, the beast roared, and wings spread from its back.</p>
    <p>The beast knelt before man, and his Creator spoke.</p>
    <p>"This is where you may start, go forth in the beautiful, and weave."</p>
    <p>Man closed his eyes. He nodded and opened them. Speaking to the beast, he said, "Bethoch you shall be called. And first of all, I give you a place to rest." So he went to his knees on the sphere of light and beauty, and set his hand down. The light began separating, each weave of color was rewoven, letting it hold a beauty of its own. The man took a single thread, and formed it into a plant. Then kneeling down, he whispered to it and, as the power of the creation flowed through his words, it grew, covering the orb in many different shapes and colors. Still on his knees, he pulled up a small patch of plant, called grass, and sees the light under it.</p>
    <p>Reaching forth again the man touched a different thread and turned it to hard rock, silent, yet lively. Ever pushing and shifting. But between the rock and the grass he wove a layer of dirt.</p>
    <p>And turning back to Bethoch he said, "I give you this place called dirt, to be your bed. Now go to stretch your wings."</p>
    <p>Bowing, the beast turned and leaped into the air, letting wings of beauty carrying him on what came about as wind. And as man watched the beast go, he saw the sky darken, but not before small lights were placed up. A light breeze blew, and he realized he was watching the creator at work again, forming the universe beyond his reach. But when this happened, a joy lit up in him. In the beauty of night, man grasped more light and began weaving it. He turned about, finding delight in weaving beasts of all kind, naming them, and setting them loose, as the rocks grew together, setting forth land, and the dirt created beds, covered in springy grass.</p>
    <p>The man then turned about, looking to tell someone of his joy, but every beast was not as he. None could man create to be as he. So turning back to the creator, man called out, asking for another creature to be with him, one to sense as he did, one to live in accordance with, exploring. And from behind came a voice...</p>
    <p>"Delightfull... All of it is."</p>
    <p>And upon turning about, man was speechless. His request was answered, but in a way he never imagined. Everything her gaze fell on, was covered in a grace and loveliness. Creatures softened, and love filled them. A graceful substance called water filled parts of Ildathore. Love for their weaver, and his mate.</p>
    <p>Locking eyes with man, she spoke again. "Here I am to share in the beauty, weaving alongside you. Forever we shall be in unison; one heart, and one will."</p>
    <p>And thus was the creation of Ildathore.<br>&nbsp</p>
