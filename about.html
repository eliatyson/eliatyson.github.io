        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>the group:<br><br><a href="./index.html" />The Flabbit Room</a> is a Christ-centered community of young creators, gathered together to share their work for the purpose of helping and encouraging each other. As everyone is created in God's image, and God is the Creator, we believe that &mdash; though it may vary from person to person, be it writing, drawing, programing, songwriting, etc. &mdash; everyone has been created to create.<br><br>We also believe in 1 Timothy 4:12: "Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith and in purity." Our hope is that this community of young creators will set an example of love and kindness, as well as creating something true, something noble, something right, something pure, something lovely, something admirable, something excellent, and something praiseworthy that ultimately points back to our Creator (Philippians 4:8).<br><br>We also believe that, as humans, creativity is to be encouraged, fostered, and grown, and used to shine a light to those around us. On account of our Biblical beliefs, we ask that you remain courteous in your words and comments here and on the <a href="./forum.html" />Forum</a>, respecting others and showing them kindness and love.<br><br>About our name:<br><br>If you do not originate from the same clan as most of us, you are most likely wondering the story behind our name, <a href="./index.html" />The Flabbit Room</a>. It is a mix between the name of the community of artists and writers that inspired us &mdash; <a href="https://rabbitroom.com" />The Rabbit Room</a> &mdash; and the (perhaps) mythical creature, the flabbit. The name was coined by Jennifer Trafton in her story "The Wooing of Sophelia Stupe." A description of these intriguing creatures can be found below:<br><br><strong style="font-size: 27pt">Flabbit</strong><br><strong>Classification:</strong> dasher / hopper / flesheater<br>"Look at the cutesy-wootsy ears!" the little children say at the festivals and fairs. "Graggle its stretchy back skin!" they exclaim. But when a flabbit is full grown, no zookeeper or traveling cageman would ever let a child near it. The flabbits dash, jump, dart, and even burrow in their haste to escape the presence of a human. But the moment the flabbit is cornered it will turn and make you its business. Its teeth (long!) will bite and its claws (sharpish!) will claw and you will not have your dinner if youâ€™re not careful because the flabbit is having his. And that dinner is you. Or part of you. as it was me. My elbow flesh. Avoid the flabbit.<br><strong>Weakness:</strong> Flight instinct. Stretchy skin. Funny-looking.<br><strong>Taste:</strong> Like skonk.<br><strong>Demeanor:</strong> Cowardly, then freaky.<br><br><i>From</i> Pembrick's Creaturepedia<i>.
