    <h2>Downfall</h2>
    <div style="text-indent: 20px;">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">The Creator called Man "Dahn," saying, "As you were first, so you shall be called." And He named Woman saying, "Ila, for, as she is graceful, so shall she be called." And He said to them both, "Be free to weave light, Dahn, Ila; explore this world of Ildathore. But should you use your gift for anything other than that, it will be taken away."</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">So Dahn and Ila created all living creatures, except for Bethoch and his kindred, who had been created by the Creator. And all creatures, from the smallest to the largest, obeyed Dahn and loved him, being content. All but one.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">That one looked on him with envy: Bethoch. The sapphire in his belly turned red, dark, as he watched Dahn's hands skillfully weaving the light. He looked at his claws, so clumsy, so... so... A smile crept upon his face. <em>Deadly.</em><br>&nbsp</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Soon Ila had a son, and she called him Ilahn. When he was young, only four passings of age, Bethoch espied the young boy playing in the night, sewing with shimmering threads. His anger doubled, and rage overtook him, so that he flew down, and took Ilahn in his claws, flying away before the eyes of the boy's mother.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Silver green eyes shone with tears as Ila watched her child being taken away. She could do nothing but cry for her husband. But she needed not, for as her lips parted and she took in breath, Dahn swept past in all his fury, running faster than any had ever run before. In his eyes a fire burned... a vengeance.<br>&nbsp</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><em>The Creator be cursed for creating such a beast!</em> Dahn's thoughts ran faster than his legs. The moons shone overhead, their rays glinting off the emerald plates of Bethoch's skin. <em>Such beauty gone to waste!</em> His toes pushed down through the soft grass, digging holes in in the spongy turf. <em>And my son... his blood will be on your hands, "Oh Maker."</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">In his anger Dahn pulled on the light, drawing about himself a cloak of reflection, turning away all color. Then he extended his left hand, letting a golden strand become sharp. <em>As the dragon's claws took my son, so shall this... dagger take your life, Bethoch, and the life of your offspring.</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">He watched as the beast flew up to a mountain, alighting on the edge of a cave. There he saw it throw down his son, letting the frail head crack.<br>&nbsp</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Bethoch landed in front of his mate, dropping the limp form before her. He flexed his shining claws, now streaked red. <em>I have found the reason for my gift from the Creator,</em> he said.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Bethochess stepped back, shielding her two children from the great beast. Her beautiful eyes had never beheld him in such a state.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Gelidor, green like his father and larger of the two young bethochs, stepped out from beneath his mother's wing, sniffing the dead body. <em>Father?</em> he asked, eyes sparkling like emeralds. <em>Did you bring it to eat?</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The great Bethoch smiled, lowering his head to the level of the young beast. <em>If you wish, my son&mdash;</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><em>Monster!</em> Bethochess stood tall, holding her neck high in strength and confidence. <em>Your sinews were woven from light, and yet you turn to darkness. You spit on the Creator, your Lord&mdash;</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;"><em>I am my Lord, As am I yours!</em> spouted the emerald creature.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">His silver blue love swallowed... but held firm. <em>You have killed a child of Dahn... you have broken creation... thus your name shall be&mdash;</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">"Dragon!" They both turned to see a dark figure striding forth, his cloak falling to the ground. As he passed through the entrance the moonlight was blocked out, and only the glowing eyes of Bethoch and his family shone in the darkness. "You took my son, you took his light." He pulled out the dagger, and it lit in his hand with a brilliance so piercing they could only stare at it.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Lifting his left hand Dahn took strands of light from the stone and reformed it, closing it in on the beats... all but one. The little bethochess had been hidden under her mother's wing... she had trusted, stayed back, fearing evil. She had been revolted by the dead body. And now she was helpless, pulled from the grasp of the great Bethochess.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The dragon roared, and his wife shrieked. Gelidor set every bit of his strength against the light... but to no avail.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The lovely creature, shimmering silver blue in the light of the moon, wept in the presence of such dark hatred. Her eyes pierced the night as she watched the dagger slide forth, parting her scales. She stared up into the face of man and said, <em>May my death be to your healing.</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The cold edge touched her heart, scattering the light, and the fiery warm touch of life blew out.<br>&nbsp</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">For the second time that night, a mother mourned for the life of her child. And not only that, but also of her husband, who had not escaped the rock that Dahn had closed around them. As the moon reached its apex, every creature stopped at the sound of Bethoch screaming before his final breath.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Still Ila grieved. When Dahn appeared, walking with the dead in his hands, she rushed forward, pulling him close and sinking to the ground. More tears fell that night than the drops of the sea...</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Then the Creator came down. <em>Dahn... what has been done this day? The death of Bethoch and his daughter?</em></p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Feeling dark before such a presence, the man had no reply, and bowed his head. But Ila stood in rage, her face stained with grief and anger.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">"You took my child! I lost my boy to Your creation! What right have You to question us so!?"</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The world flashed with an indescribable brightness. Light filled their very minds of so that neither had the will to stand. Both trembled and fell to their faces.<br>&nbsp</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; text-align: center; text-indent: 0px;"><em>I am The Shaper,<br>You are My clay.<br>Unto you did this I not say?<br>And also to Dahn My son,<br>That anything other than weaving,<br>Would bring this gift to its leaving?<br>Now do I take it,<br>No longer is it yours.<br>Away from you this power pours.</em><br>&nbsp</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">All dimmed once again, and with the departure of the light, Dahn's hands lost their golden hue, as did Ila's their silver glow.</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">Both wept, and Ila spoke: "On this land was my heart split in two. It shall be called Vanya."</p>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">And so happened the downfall of man, though not without hope. For as each held the other in their arms, and their tears fell to the ground, a tree grew. A tree with a fruit. A tree from the Creator.<br>&nbsp</p>
