      <h1>Ildathore</h1>
      <p>is a collaborative world-building and storytelling project. Most of the writing in <a href="./index.html" style="color: rgb(190, 190, 190)" />The Flabbit Room</a> is done for Ildathore, and all of the published stories (as well as a map of the world) can be found below. We recommend reading through them chronologically, as they are listed. (Note: in <i>The Legends of Matt Baker</i>, all of the stories except "The Mapmaker" take place after "Impressions.")</p>
